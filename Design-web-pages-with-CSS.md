**We have to take into consideration when we choose the foreground and the backiground colors the following :**
1. Contrast (it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.)
   * Low Contrast (Text is harder to read)
   * High Contrast (Text is easier to read)
   * Medium Contrast (For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability)

 2. HSL (which we mentioned above)

 ### **Finaly it seems that when we have to use color to design our web pages we have to :**

 * Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
 * There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
 * Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
 * It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
 * CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
