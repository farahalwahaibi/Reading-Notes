## **Stacks and Queues**

### **What is Stacks ?**
*is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted and deleted only from one side of the list, called the top. A stack follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle, i.e., the element inserted at the last is the first element to come out.*

* So For the insertion we use ### **PUSH**
* So For the deletion we use ### **POP**


*In stack we always keep track of the last element present in the list with a pointer called top.*

### **What is Queue ?**
*is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted only from one side of the list called rear, and the elements can be deleted only from the other side called the front. The queue data structure follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle, i.e. the element inserted at first in the list, is the first element to be removed from the list.*

* So For the insertion we use ### **ENQUEUE**
* So For the deletion we use ### **DEQUEUE**


*In queue we always maintain the element which was inserted at the first and still present in the list with the front pointer.*
