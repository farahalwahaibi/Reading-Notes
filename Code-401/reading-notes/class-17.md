# **AWS: S3 and Lambda**


### **let's 1st answer these questions**

**1. Describe “The Cloud”**
*refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. ... By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.*

**2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?**
*A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.*

**3. What is auto-scaling?**
*Auto scaling, also referred to as autoscaling, auto-scaling, and sometimes automatic scaling, is a cloud computing technique for dynamically allocating computational resources. Depending on the load to a server farm or pool, the number of servers that are active will typically vary automatically as user needs fluctuate.*

**4. What is bandwidth?**
*is measured as the amount of data that can be transferred from one point to another within a network in a specific amount of time. Typically, bandwidth is expressed as a bitrate and measured in bits per second (bps).*


### **Vocabulary Terms**
* **Server Instances** 
*is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance.*

* **Containers** 
*is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.*

* **Cloud Services**
*refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet.*

* **Cloud Architecture** 
*refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc.*

* **AWS** 
*Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally.*

### **AWS S3**

#### **What is AWS S3 ?**

*Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites.*


### **AWS Lambda**

#### **What is AWS Lambda**

*is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes.*


### **AWS Lambda Functions**

#### **What is AWS Lambda Functions**

*The code you run on AWS Lambda is uploaded as a “Lambda function”. Each function has associated configuration information, such as its name, description, entry point, and resource requirements. The code must be written in a “stateless” style i.e. it should assume there is no affinity to the underlying compute infrastructure.*
