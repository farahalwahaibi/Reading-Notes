# **AWS: Cloud Servers**

### **let's 1st answer these questions**

**1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle ?**
*First a user gives a client a URL, the client builds a request for information (or resources) to be generated by a server. When the server receives that request, it uses the information included in the request to build a response that contains the requested information. Once built, that response is sent back to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user.*

**2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC ?**
*is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client. In a data center, the physical computer that a server program runs on is also frequently referred to as a server.*

**3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?**
*To put it in the web server*

### **AWS**

#### **What is AWS?**

*Cloud computing gives you access to servers, storage, databases, and a broad set of application services over the Internet. A cloud services provider such as Amazon Web Services, owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.*


### **Virtual Machines**

#### **What is Virtual Machine**

*is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system (located off- or on-premises).*


### **Virtualization**

#### **What is Virtualization**

*is the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources. Virtualization began in the 1960s, as a method of logically dividing the system resources provided by mainframe computers between different applications. Since then, the meaning of the term has broadened.[1]*
