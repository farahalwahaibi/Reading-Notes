# **Ethics**

### **Ethics In Tech**

*Technology has always called itself an agent of making the world a better place, and yes, there are many examples of how technology has improved the lives of millions or even billions of people. But there are also some very disturbing side effects which have resulted from the massive proliferation of technology in our daily lives.*


### **Privacy and Data Ownership**
* Every day when we browse social media, use a smart speaker to search the web or download a podcast, we give our data to companies that can use it in ways we may not approve or sell it to companies we don't support.
* All that data that is constantly being collected, shared or sold can have huge impacts on our lives from just seeing news stories that fit our personal beliefs or even turning down a credit card or loan.
* We give up our data unintentionally and we need to find a way to take back ownership and value of our data.

### **Impacts of Data**
* In the UK, the data was used to influence votes and eventually led to Brexit despite the overwhelming realities that the UK would be better off if it stayed in the EU.
* In the United States, politicians have used data and social media to spread lies and hate across our nation, which led to the election of a demagogue as our president.
* Both events were the result of highly specific data mining and targeting. When companies or political groups use personalization, also known as discrimination, to target specific messages to specific people, alternative versions are created, sometimes for the purpose of creating instability.

### **What Shall we do, or what can we do?**
* The first thing is to turn off any data collection we can do in all the apps and websites we use.
* Second, call and write to Congress to request updated legislation to protect individuals' data and return data ownership to individuals at that time.
* Finally, reduce data sharing by not logging into any site with your Google or Facebook account. These are some of the biggest data collection points and give these companies access to a range of data they don't normally receive.
