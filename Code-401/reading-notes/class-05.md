## **What is Linked Lists ?**
*is a collection of data elements that are arranged in a specific order. A node in a linked list may represent a data unit. Each node has two components: data and a pointer to the next node.*

*A linked list is made up of data elements or nodes that are linked together by pointers.*


## **Two types of Linked Lists :**

* **Singly linked list** means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

* **Doubly linked list** means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.



### **So What's the element of linked list :**

1. **Nodes** :are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.

2. **Next** :Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node,it will lead us where the next node is and allow us to extract the data appropriately.

3. **The Head** :is a reference type of type Node to the first node in a linked list.


### **Advantages for linked lists :**

* Insertion and deletion operations are easier.

* Efficient memory utilization.

* Linked list can expand in constant time.

* Linked is a dynamic data structure.


### **DisAdvantages :**

* Reverse Traversing is difficult in the linked list(though we can achieve this with the help of Doubly Linked List).

* The memory is wasted as pointers require extra memory for storage.

* No element can be accessed randomly, it has to access each node sequentially i.e. proper traversal must be done.
