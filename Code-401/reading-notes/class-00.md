## **How to Solve Programming Problems**
*This time I am going to try and give you some good tools to enable you to get good at solving programming problems.*

### **A simple set of steps :**
* **Read the problem completely twice :**
*If you don’t understand the problem, you cannot solve it.  Do not worry about wasting time here, because the better you understand the problem, the easier it will be to solve it.*

* **Solve the problem manually :**
*It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate, otherwise you are just slinging code around.*

* **Optimize the manual solution :**
*People often don’t realize how valuable this step is.  It is much easier to rearrange and reconstruct and idea or algorithm in your head than it is in code. It’s well worth the effort to try and optimize the actual solution or simplify it when it is still in the most easily malleable state.*

* **Write pseudo-code or comments :**
*If you are a beginner or struggle with these kinds of problems, I would go ahead and take the time to do this step anyway though.*

* **Replace comments with real code :**
*All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.*

* **Optimize the real code :**
*Sometimes this step isn’t necessary, but it’s worth taking a look at your code and figuring out if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler.*

* **A few final tips :**
*If you follow this template for solving algorithm type problem, you should do very well in programming interviews, but the key to doing so is having confidence in this process. The only way you are going to have confidence in this process is to practice it.  It takes a good amount of faith to believe that spending 70% of your 30 minutes to solve a problem just thinking about the problem and not writing any code is the right approach, so make sure you have that faith when you need it.*

## **Act like you make $1000/hr**
*Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do — and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in.*

### **Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000 :**

* What would your life look like?
* What people would you stop putting up with?
* What problems would you stop wasting time on?
* What things would you stop — and start — doing?

**Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness**
*If you let it, your world and the people around you will take all your time. Your time is not unlike your paycheck; if you don’t budget for things, you’ll have nothing left over by the end of the month. We’re all busy — with work, our families, our friends. It’s not bad to be “busy.” But in the words of best-selling author Jeff Goins:*

**“The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”**

**Busyness and Stress Are the Enemy**
*For world-class performers, busyness and stress are the enemy. They’re a sign you’re off-track. It means you’ve been lazy and undisciplined, and have let too many unimportant tasks take you away from what really matters.*

**“Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss**
**Do you want incredible productivity? *Then cultivate extreme focus with whatever you do.* If you don’t manage your time, it will manage you.**

**You Can Do Amazing Things, But Only If You Have Time to Do Them**
*“The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.” -Warren Buffet*

*Every time you say yes to something, it means you’re saying “no” to a dozen other opportunities. The world’s most successful and extraordinary people say no to almost everything, but yes to a few things. Warren Buffet, investor extraordinaire and a net worth of over $70 billion dollars, has said that for every hundred opportunities he is given, he might say yes to 1–2 of them.*

**Really successful people say no to most things, because most things won’t get them to where they truly want to be.**

### **“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.”** *Steve Jobs*

## **How to think like a programmer**
*More effective way for problem solving.*

* **Why is this important?**
*Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design.*

* **Have a framework :**
*“The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.” — V. Anton Spraul*

**So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?**
1. **Understand :**
*Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).*

2. **Plan :**
*Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!*

3. **Divide :**
*Pay attention. This is the most important step of all. Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry. Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.*

4. **Stuck ?**
*The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated. In fact, here are three things to try when facing a whammy:*

  * Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
  
  * Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?

  * Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).

5. **Practice :**
*In fact, a common pattern amongst successful people is their habit of practicing “micro problem-solving.” For example, Peter Thiel plays chess, and Elon Musk plays video-games.*

## **5 Whys**
**Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly**

### **How to Use the 5 Whys :**

1. **Assemble a Team :**
*Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.*

2. **Define the Problem :**
*If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on*

3. **Ask the First "Why?" :**
*Ask your team why the problem is occurring. (For example, "Why isn't Team A meeting its response time targets?")*

4. **Ask "Why?" Four More Times :**
*For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.*

5. **Know When to Stop :**
*If you identified more than one reason in Step 3, repeat this process for each of the different branches of your analysis until you reach a root cause for each one.*

6. **Address the Root Cause(s) :**
*Now that you've identified at least one root cause, you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.*

7. **Monitor Your Measures :**
*Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem. You may need to amend them, or replace them entirely. If this happens, it's a good idea to repeat the 5 Whys process to ensure that you've identified the correct root cause.*
