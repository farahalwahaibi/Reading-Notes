# **Data Modeling**

## **let's 1st answer these questions**

1. **Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development ?**
 * Writing the tests first requires you to really consider what do you want from the code.
 * You receive fast feedback.
 * TDD creates a detailed specification.
 * TDD reduces time spent on rework.
 * You spend less time in the debugger.
 * You are able to identify the errors and problems quickly.

2. **In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite ?**
 * We need the afterEach() method to rest the database after run the test, while the beforeEach() we called before the test running.


3. **What is one downside of Test Driven Development ?**
 * Not running tests frequently enough; Writing tests that are too large; Writing too many tests at once; Writing insignificant tests.


4. **Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes ?**
 * The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.


## **Vocabulary Terms**

* **functional programming** 
*is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.*

* **object-oriented programming (OOP)**
*is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).*

* **Classes**
*Are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.*

* **Test Driven Development (TDD)**
*It is a programming practice which involves developing tests for every small functionality of an application.*

* **Jest**
*Javascript testing framework*

* **Continuous Integration (CI)**
*It's a set of practices that drive development teams to implement small changes as a mechanism to integrate and validate changes.*

* **REST**
*stand for Representational State Transfer and it is an architectural pattern which work with plain text, XML, HTML and JSON can make use of SOAP.*

* **Data Model**
*is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.*
