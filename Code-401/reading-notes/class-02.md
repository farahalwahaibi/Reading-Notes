## **1st let's answers these questions :**

1. ### **What is the difference between put and patch?**

***Put and Patch are request which used under UPDATE method , So both of them are using for update with different usage as the following :***

**PUT request** is particularly useful for major updates, it's update the whole content and replaced the old with the new one even if we need to update one property  
**PATCH request** is particularly useful for minor updates, just update the properties which we determined without replace the whole content .
 

2. ### **Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server ?**

***Mocking HTTP requests is the ability to test a wide range of possible situations and realities, it presents a great opportunity to really future proof your API.***

* [Nock](https://github.com/nock/nock)
* [MockServer](https://www.mock-server.com/)
* [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/)
 

3. ### **Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js ?**

- **API documentation** is essentially the reference manual for an API – It tells API consumers how to use the API

- **Swagger**  is a free cloud-based API testing and documentation tool to simplify the validation of any API and generate its corresponding OpenAPI documentation.
