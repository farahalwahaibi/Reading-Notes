## **What is Remote Repositories ?**

**In order to collaborate on Git projects, you must interact with remote repositories, versions of a project residing online or on a network. You can work with multiple repositories, for which you can have read/write or read-only privileges. Teams can use remote repositories to push information to and pull data from.**

## **The Most Commonly Remote Commands :**
### 1. **git clone URL** : (Cloned Repositories By cloning the file, you have copied all versions of all files for a project).
### 2. **git remote** : (view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles).
### 3. **git remote -v** : (view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names).
### 4. **git remote add shortname url** : (create a new remote Git repository with a short name).
### 5. **git fetch [remote-name]** : (Fetching entails pulling data that you don’t have from a remote project).
### 6. **git push [remote-name][branch-name]** : (This command pushes committed changes from your local “master” branch upstream to the “origin” server).
### 7. **git remote rename** : (To rename a remote’s short name).
### 8. **git remote rm** : (To remove a remote for whatever reason).
