### **Images rollovers and sprits:**
1. Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it (known as a rollover) and a third style when they click on it.
2. When a single image is used for several different parts of an interface, it is known as a sprite. You can add the logo and other interface elements, as well as buttons to the image.
* ex.
![rollovers and sprits](IMG/class11.JPG)

![rollovers and sprits](IMG/class11-1.JPG)


### **Contrast the background :**
If you want to overlay text on a background image the image must be low contrast in order for the text to be legible.
* High Contrast :makes the text difficult to read.
* Low Contrast : makes the text easier to read.
* Screen :added to a high contrast image makes the text easier to read.

# **CH.19 : Practical Information**

### **Search Engine Optimization** :
Is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results. 
* On-page techniques: are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines by using the text in your html page .
* Off-Page Techniques: about how to link your website with the other websites .

Search engines also look at the words between the opening `<a>` tag and closing `</a>` tag in the link. If the text in the link contains keywords (rather than just click here or your website address) it may be considered more relevant.

### **On-Page :**
there are seven key places where keywords can appear in order to improve its findability :

1. Page Title
2. URL / Web Address
3. Headings
4. TEXT
5. LINK TEXT
6. IMAGE ALT TEXT 
7. Page Descriptions :lives inside the `<head>` element and is specified using a `<meta>` tag. It should be a sentence that describes the content.


### **How to Identify Keywords and Phrases :**
1. Brainstorm
2. Organize
3. Research
4. Compare 
5. Refine 
6. Map


### **Analytics: Learning about your Visitors :**
* Signing Up :The Google Analytics service relies on you signing up for an account at:
www.google.com/analytics
The site will give you a piece of tracking code which you need to put on every page of your site.

* How it Works :Every time someone loads a page of your site, the tracking code sends data to the Google servers where it is stored. Google then provides a web based interface that allows you to see how visitors use your site.

* The Tracking Code :A tracking code is provided by Google Analytics for each website you are tracking. It should appear just before the closing `</head>` tag. The code does not alter the appearance of your web pages.

### **How Many People Are Coming to Your Site?**
* Visits :This is the number of times people have come to your site. If someone is inactive on your site for 30 minutes and then looks at another page on your site, it will be counted as a new visit.

* Unique Visits :This is the total number of people who have visited your site over the specified period. The number of unique visits will be lower than the number of visits if people have been returning to your site more than once in the defined period.

* Page Views :The total number of pages all visitors have viewed on your site.

* Pages per Visit :The average number of pages each visitor has looked at on your site per visit.

* Average Time on Site :The average amount of time
each user has spent on the site per visit.

* Date Selector :Using the date selector in the top
right hand corner of the site, you can change the period of time the reports display. When you log in, this is usually set to the last month, but you can change it to report on a specific time period.

* Export :The export link just above the title that says "visitors overview" allows you to export the statistics on this page for other applications such as Excel.


### **The traffic sources link on the left hand side allows you to learn where your visitors are coming from.**
* Referrers
* Direct
* Search Term
* Advanced Feature

**File Transfer Protocol (or FTP) allows you to transfer files across the Internet from your computer to the web server hosting your site**
