# **THE PAST, PRESENT & FUTURE OF LOCAL STORAGE FOR WEB APPLICATIONS**

**Historically, web applications have had none of these luxuries. Cookies were invented early in the web’s history, and indeed they can be used for persistent local storage of small amounts of data. But they have three potentially dealbreaking downsides**

* Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over
* Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over SSL)
* Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data — enough to slow down your application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful


**What we really want is :**

* a lot of storage space 
* on the client
* persists beyond a page refresh
* isn’t transmitted to the server

**what is HTML5 Storage? Simply put, it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser.**

**From your JavaScript code, you’ll access HTML5 Storage through the localStorage object on the global window object. Before you can use it, you should detect whether the browser supports it.**
***

### check for HTML5 Storage :
function supports_html5_storage() {
  try {
    return 'localStorage' in window && window`['localStorage']` !== null;
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
}
Instead of writing this function yourself, you can use Modernizr to detect support for HTML5 Storage.

if (Modernizr.localstorage) {
  // window.localStorage is available!
} else {
  // no native support for HTML5 storage :(
  // maybe try dojox.storage or a third-party solution
}

***
### USING HTML5 STORAGE :
interface Storage {
  getter any getItem(in DOMString key);
  setter creator void setItem(in DOMString key, in any data);
};
Calling setItem() with a named key that already exists will silently overwrite the previous value. Calling getItem() with a non-existent key will return null rather than throw an exception.

Like other JavaScript objects, you can treat the localStorage object as an associative array. Instead of using the getItem() and setItem() methods, you can simply use square brackets. For example, this snippet of code:

var foo = localStorage.getItem("bar");
// ...
localStorage.setItem("bar", foo);
…could be rewritten to use square bracket syntax instead:

var foo = localStorage`["bar"]`;
// ...
localStorage`["bar"]` = foo;
There are also methods for removing the value for a given named key, and clearing the entire storage area (that is, deleting all the keys and values at once).

interface Storage {
  deleter void removeItem(in DOMString key);
  void clear();
};
Calling removeItem() with a non-existent key will do nothing.

Finally, there is a property to get the total number of values in the storage area, and to iterate through all of the keys by index (to get the name of each key).

interface Storage {
  readonly attribute unsigned long length;
  getter DOMString key(in unsigned long index);
};
If you call key() with an index that is not between 0–(length-1), the function will return null.

### TRACKING CHANGES TO THE HTML5 STORAGE AREA :
if (window.addEventListener) {
  window.addEventListener("storage", handle_storage, false);
} else {
  window.attachEvent("onstorage", handle_storage);
};
The handle_storage callback function will be called with a StorageEvent object, except in Internet Explorer where the event object is stored in window.event.

function handle_storage(e) {
  if (!e) { e = window.event; }
}
At this point, the variable e will be a StorageEvent object, which has the following useful properties.

### HTML5 STORAGE IN ACTION :
How does it work? Every time a change occurs within the game, we call this function:

function saveGameState() {
    if (!supportsLocalStorage()) { return false; }
    localStorage`["halma.game.in.progress"]` = gGameInProgress;
    for (var i = 0; i < kNumPieces; i++) {
	localStorage["halma.piece." + i + ".row"] = gPieces[i].row;
	localStorage["halma.piece." + i + ".column"] = gPieces[i].column;
    }
    localStorage["halma.selectedpiece"] = gSelectedPieceIndex;
    localStorage["halma.selectedpiecehasmoved"] = gSelectedPieceHasMoved;
    localStorage["halma.movecount"] = gMoveCount;
    return true;
}
***
### BEYOND NAMED KEY-VALUE PAIRS: COMPETING VISIONS :
actual working code in 4 browsers

openDatabase('documents', '1.0', 'Local document storage', 5*1024*1024, function (db) {
  db.changeVersion('', '1.0', function (t) {
    t.executeSql('CREATE TABLE docids (id, name)');
  }, error);
});
