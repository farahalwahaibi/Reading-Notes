# **Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry**

1. ## **Time When Women Stopped Coding :**

*A lot of computing pioneers — the people who programmed the first digital computers — were women. And for decades, the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men. But in ***1984***, something changed. The percentage of women in computer science flattened, and then plunged, even as the share of women in other technical and professional fields (Links to an external site.) kept rising.*

*In the ***1990s***, researcher Jane Margolis  (Links to an external site.)interviewed hundreds of computer science students at Carnegie Mellon University, which had one of the top programs in the country. She found that families were much more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls — even when their girls were really interested in computers.*

3. ## **Why diversity matters to your tech company :**

*For me , We know that diversity matters. We know that companies and societies flourish when they are safe for all identities and when we listen to the wider range of human experience. Diversity is what fosters innovation and opens us up to new problems and ideas.*
