# **Refactoring**

## **What is refactoring?**

*means updating the source code without changing the behaviour of the application. Refactoring helps you keep your code solid, dry, and easy to maintain.*

## **What is functional programming? **
*is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data*

## **What is pure function :**
*Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable. Given the same parameters, pure functions will always return the same result.*

## **Pure functions benefits :**
* Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B 
* Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D
