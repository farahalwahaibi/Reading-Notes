# **Update/Delete**


## **defining how to send the data:**

### **The method attribute:**
*The action attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL. If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form â€” the current page.*

### **The method attribute:**
* **The GET method:**
*The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.*


* **The POST method:**
*The POST method is a little different. It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.*

**The only thing displayed to the user is the URL called. As we mentioned above, with a GET request the user will see the data in their URL bar, but with a POST request they won't. This can be very important for two reasons:**

* If you need to send a password (or any other sensitive piece of data), never use the GET method or you risk displaying it in the URL bar, which would be very insecure.
* If you need to send a large amount of data, the POST method is preferred because some browsers limit the sizes of URLs. In addition, many servers limit the length of URLs they accept.

**A special case: sending files**:
If you want to send files, you need to take three extra steps:

* Set the method attribute to POST because file content can't be put inside URL parameters.
* Set the value of enctype to multipart/form-data because the data will be split into multiple parts, one for each file plus one for the text data included in the form body (if text is also entered into the form).
* Include one or more `<input type="file">` controls to allow your users to select the file(s) that will be uploaded.

**Summary**

*As we'd alluded to above, sending form data is easy, but securing an application can be tricky. Just remember that a front-end developer is not the one who should define the security model of the data.It's possible to perform client-side form validation, but the server can't trust this validation because it has no way to truly know what has really happened on the client-side.*

*If you've worked your way through these tutorials in order, you now know how to markup and style a form, do client-side validation, and have some idea about submitting a form.*
